# interest_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

This is a project that allows a user to select a minimum of 3 interests and maximum of 7 from a curated list of interests with the following goals:

The user selected interests appear in the selected section shown at the bottom side of the UI screen and disappear in the remaining list of interests.

The user is able to use the search box to quickly find an interest from a large pool of interests.

The next button is only active when the user has selected a minimum of 3 interests and disabled after the user has selected a maximum of 7 interests from the list.
